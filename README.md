# Asteroids!

Use the arrow keys to control the ship. Up to increase thrust, down to decrease thrust,
left to turn the ship's heading left, and right to turn the ship's heading right.

You'll have to increase thrust when the ship's heading is turned in order for your craft
to move in the direction it's pointing. Remember: in space, an object in motion stays in motion,
until acted upon by an external force!

The asteroids bump into each other. Blow them up out of your way! Your bullets are incindiery.
They will make any object in its path explode!!

Also, this quadrant of space-time has the topology of a toroidal surface, so all the objects  in view
will appear to wrap from one viewing boundary to another. Fear not, this is a feature of the two dimensional 
projection of the plane of existence.
