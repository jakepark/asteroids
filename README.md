# Asteroids!

Use the arrow keys to control the ship.
UP to increase thrust,
DOWN to decrease thrust,
LEFT to turn the ship's heading left,
RIGHT to turn the ship's heading right.
SPACEBAR to fire main canon!!

You'll have to increase thrust when the ship's heading is turned in order for
your craft to move in the direction it's pointing.

Remember: in space, an object in motion stays in motion, until acted upon
by an external force!

The asteroids bump into each other. Blow them up outta your way!
Your bullets are incendiery. They will make any object in its path explode!!

Also, this quadrant of space-time has the topology of a toroidal surface,
so all the objects in view will appear to wrap from one viewing boundary to
another. Fear not, this is a feature of the two dimensional projection of
this plane of existence.
